   ✓ Real-world implementations documented
   ✓ Selection guidance provided
   
3. FLAG NAMING AND CONSISTENCY
   ✓ Standard flags catalog (-h, -v, -q, -f, -a, -n, -m, -d, -i, -t)
   ✓ Kebab-case rules documented
   ✓ Short/long form pairing guidelines
   ✓ Related flag grouping patterns
   
4. HELP TEXT STRUCTURE AND CLARITY
   ✓ Three-level help system documented
   ✓ Help text best practices with examples
   ✓ Example-driven approach emphasized
   ✓ Next steps and guidance patterns
   
5. ERROR MESSAGE PATTERNS
   ✓ Five error categories with examples
